**I'm building this application using the following technologies:**

- ⚙️ **.NET 9**
- 🌐 **HTML**
- 🎨 **CSS**
- 🅱️ **Bootstrap**
- ✨ **JavaScript**
- 🛢️ **SQL Server**
- 🗃️ **Entity Framework Core**
- 🧩 **ASP.NET Core MVC**
- 🧱 **Clean Architecture**
- ✅ **xUnit** (for unit testing)
- 🧪 **Moq** (for mocking dependencies)

**Here's what I've implemented so far:**

1. ✅ Created the **Admin page** with **Login** and **Registration** functionality using **ASP.NET Core Identity** with **role-based authentication**.
2. 🔗 Connected the project to a **SQL Server database**, storing the connection string securely in the `appsettings.json` file.
3. 🧱 Designed **Entities** and **DTOs (CModels)** to prevent direct exposure of entities in **Controllers** and **Services**.
4. 🔄 Established a **One-to-One relationship** between **Product** and **Category**, and implemented corresponding **Repository Interfaces and Implementations**.
5. 🧪 Added **Unit Tests** for the repository classes using **xUnit** to ensure reliability and correctness.
6. ⚙️ Integrated a **CI/CD pipeline** for smooth and automated deployment using **.NET Core DevOps practices**.
